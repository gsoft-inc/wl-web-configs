[[{"l":"Getting started","p":["Welcome to @workleap/web-configs, a collection of configuration libraries for building web applications at Workleap. On this getting started page, you'll find an overview of the project and a list of supported tools."]},{"i":"why-we-built-these-libraries","l":"Why we built these libraries?","p":["Starting a new web application is still an arduous task. There are so many tools to choose from, learn, install and configure, it can be daunting.","For an organization like Workleap, with a large suite of products, it doesn't make sense to start over every time we invest in a new idea or add a new vertical to an existing product. Developers working on a new project shouldn't spend their first day's figuring out which ESLint rules to enable/disable, or how to transpile their React code, they should rather focus on writing features code."]},{"l":"Filling the gap","p":["While a collection of common configurations gets us closer to that goal, on their own, configuration libraries are not enough to reach it. There is still a need to install and assemble those configurations correctly in the new application, which can also be a challenge. To fill this gap, we choosed to invest as well in a CLI to scaffold new web applications and libraries."]},{"l":"Best of both worlds","p":["With the CLI, developers can generate fully configured web applications in a few minutes. However, contrary to configuration libraries, a CLI alone is only good at creating the initial files of an application, it doesn't help with the maintenance or the adoption of new features offered by tools over time.","That's why we need both, there's a strong synergy between a collection of configuration libraries and a CLI.","With configuration libraries distributed through NPM packages and installed with a CLI, when a new feature is available for a tool, the configuration libraries maintainers can spend time learning the new feature, making the necessary changes, and distributing the changes with a new version of the package. Then, at their convenience, product teams can adopt the changes by bumping the configuration library package version in their respective application.","We hope that introducing CLI with a collection of configuration libraries will facilitate the creation and maintenance of front-end projects."]},{"l":"Guiding principles","p":["While developing the configuration libraries, we kept one guiding principle in mind, no locked in❤️✌️.
