# Getting started

Welcome to `workleap/web-configs`, a collection of **configuration libraries** for building web applications at [Workleap](https://workleap.com/). On this getting started page, you'll find an overview of the project and a list of supported tools.

!!!warning Before you continue...

The preferred way for using these configuration libraries is **not** by installing them manually, but rather by **scaffolding** your application with Workleap's [foundry-cli](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-foundry-cli).

+++ pnpm
```bash
pnpm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ yarn
```bash
yarn create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ npm
```bash
npm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++

## Why?

Starting a new web application is still an arduous task. There are so many tools to choose from, learn, install and configure, it can be daunting.

For an organization like [Workleap](https://workleap.com/), with a large suite of products, it **doesn't make sense to start over every time** we invest in a new idea or add a new vertical to an existing product. Developers working on a new project shouldn't spend their first day's figuring out which [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules to enable/disable, or how to transpile their [React](https://react.dev/) code, they should rather **focus on writing features code**.

### Filling the gap

While a collection of common configurations gets us closer to that goal, on their own, configuration libraries are not enough to reach it. There is still a need to install and assemble those configurations correctly in the new application, which can also be a challenge. To fill this gap, we choosed to invest as well in a [CLI](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-foundry-cli) to scaffold new web applications and libraries.

### Best of both worlds

With the CLI, developers can generate fully configured web applications in a few minutes. However, contrary to configuration libraries, a CLI alone is only good at creating the initial files of an application, it doesn't help with the **maintenance** or the **adoption of new features** offered by tools over time.

That's why we need both, there's a strong synergy between a collection of configuration libraries and a CLI.

With configuration libraries **distributed through NPM packages** and installed with a CLI, when a new feature is available for a tool, the configuration libraries maintainers can spend time learning the new feature, making the necessary changes, and **distributing the changes with a new version** of the package. Then, at their convenience, **product teams can adopt the changes** by bumping the configuration library package version in their respective application.

We hope that introducing CLI with a collection of configuration libraries will facilitate the creation and maintenance of front-end projects.

## Guiding principles

While developing the configuration libraries, we kept one guiding principle in mind, **no locked in** :heart::v:. We truly hope that the default configurations will satisfy your application needs, but if it doesn't, there will always be an easy way to extend or override the default configuration.

## Target environment

The majority of the shared tooling configurations targets [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and the latest [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) version (ESNext). If you are in the process of migrating an existing project to `workleap/web-configs`, and would rather delay transitioning to ESM, have a look at the _Target environment_ section of each tool for additional information about how to support **non ESM compliant** solutions.
