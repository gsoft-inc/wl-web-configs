# Stylelint

!!!warning Before you continue...

The preferred way for using this [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) shared configuration is **not** by installing it manually, but rather by **scaffolding** your application with Workleap's [foundry-cli](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-foundry-cli).

+++ pnpm
```bash
pnpm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ yarn
```bash
yarn create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ npm
```bash
npm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++

## Sass

While [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) still offers numerous advantages, as we actively work on improving our build time and **minimize** the number of tools **compiling/transpiling** frontend code, we choose to move away from Sass and not provide any Stylelint's rules for Sass. If you are still using Sass strictly for nesting, note that [native support for nesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/) is coming soon to CSS.

## Prettier

Since `v15.0.0`, Stylelint's stylistic rules [has been deprecated](https://stylelint.io/migration-guide/to-15#deprecated-stylistic-rules). The current recommendation is to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) instead to format CSS files.

For that reason, this library shared configurations includes the [stylelint-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/stylelint-prettier) plugin. Using this plugin, Prettier changes are exposed as Stylelint's rule violations.

Since we choose to [stick with ESLint for JavaScript and JSON stylistic rules](../eslint/default.md#prettier), a `.prettierignore` file must be added at the root of the solution to ignore everything but CSS files:

``` .prettierignore
*
!**/*.css
```

Otherwise, Prettier will also format your `.js,.json,.ts` files and you'll end up with conflicts between Prettier and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Getting started

To get started, choose one of the following scenarios :point_down:

### Setup a new project

If you are looking to setup a **new** polyrepo solution (single project per repository), follow the guide to [setup a polyrepo](setup-polyrepo.md), otherwise, follow the guide to [setup a monorepo](setup-monorepo.md).

### Setup an existing project

If you are migrating an **existing** polyrepo solution (single project per repository) to `workleap/web-configs`, follow the guide to [setup a polyrepo](setup-polyrepo.md), otherwise, follow the guide to [setup a monorepo](setup-monorepo.md).

Once configured, to understand how to adapt this library default configurations to your codebase while you are completing the migration, have a look at the [custom configuration](custom-configuration.md) page.
