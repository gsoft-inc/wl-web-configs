# Rslib

<!-- !!!warning Before you continue...

The preferred way for using `@workleap/webpack-configs` is **not** by installing the library manually, but rather by **scaffolding** your application with Workleap's [foundry-cli](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-foundry-cli).

+++ pnpm
```bash
pnpm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ yarn
```bash
yarn create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ npm
```bash
npm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
